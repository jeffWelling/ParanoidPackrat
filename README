This is the ParanoidPackrat backup program.
If you are using this in production use already,
your retarded and should be shot, and then
peed on and then shot again.  This is in
development and should not yet be used in 
production systems.

ParanoidPackrat is intended to be used to backup
multiple files and folders onto one or more hard
drives.  It will have configurable redundancy, so
you can specify how many copies you want to keep,
across how many devices.  For more detail, see
