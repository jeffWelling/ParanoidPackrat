Testing has shown that if you have two files somewhere in your backup target, and they are hardlinked, and you perform a backup, and then perform another backup so that if you were to stat the file on the backup drive the links should show 4, and then you go to restore from last backup (WITH the -H option!), then it restores the backup exactly as you would hope.  HOWEVER, if you run shrinkBackupDest and it hardlinks duplicates in the same backup, then when you restore those backups the files will be hardlinked which breaks the convention of getting your backup out exactly as you commited them.  That is not a showstopper however.  shrinkBackupDest should be optional?
